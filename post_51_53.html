                I, AVINASH SEN (Univ. Reg. No. TCR18MEMS04) hereby declare that the project report “DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A DEEP LEARNING BASED ROBOTIC BIN PICKING VISION SYSTEM USING ROS”, submitted for partial fulfillment of the requirements for the award of degree of Master of Technology of the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University, 
                Kerala is a bonafide work done by me under supervision of Aju S S, Associate Professor Dept. of Production Engineering, Government Engineering College, Thrissur. This submission represents my ideas in my own words and where ideas or words of others have been included; I have adequately and accurately cited and referenced the original sources. 
                I also declare that I have adhered to ethics of academic honesty and integrity and have not misrepresented or fabricated any data or idea or fact or source in my submission.

              <b>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</b>
              <p>
                During the course of my project work several persons collaborated directly and indirectly with me. Without their support it would be impossible for me to finish my work. That is why I wish to dedicate this section to recognize their support. I want to start expressing my thanks to my project guide Aju S S, Asst. Professor Dept. of Production Engineering, because of his valuable advice and guidance towards this work. I received motivation; encouragement and hold up from his during the course of work.
                I am thankful to Dr. Manjith Kumar, Head of Production Engineering Department, and our Principal Dr. Sheeba V.S, for their sole co-operation. I would like to thank our Project Coordinator Dr. Satish K.P for his sincere support throughout the project presentation.
                I am grateful to express my thanks to all the faculty members of our Production Engineering department for their support. I articulate my gratitude to all my associates and colleagues for their support and help for this work. Last, but not the least I wish to express my gratitude to God Almighty for His   abundant blessings without which this effort would not have been successful.
              </p>
